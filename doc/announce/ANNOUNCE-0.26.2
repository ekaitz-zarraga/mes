ABOUT

GNU Mes is a Scheme interpreter and C compiler for bootstrapping the
GNU System.  It has helped to decimate the number and size of binary
seeds that were used in the bootstrap of GNU Guix 1.0.  Recently,
version 0.24.2 has realized the first Full Source Bootstrap for Guix
<https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2023/the-full-source-bootstrap-building-from-source-all-the-way-down/>.
The final goal is to help create a full source bootstrap as part of
the bootstrappable builds effort <https://bootstrappable.org> for any
UNIX-like operating system.

Mes + MesCC + Mes C Library can build a bootstrappable TinyCC
<https://gitlab.com/janneke/tinycc> that is self-hosting.  Using this
bootstrappable-tcc and the Mes C library we can build an ancient
version of the GNU tools triplet: glibc-2.2.5, binutils-2.20.1,
gcc-2.95.3.  This is enough to bootstrap Guix for i686-linux,
x86_64-linux, armhf-linux and aarch64-linux.

Mes was inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software: LISP-1.5 --
John McCarthy page 13, Guix's source/binary packaging transparency and
Jeremiah Orians's Stage0 <https://github.com/oriansj/stage0>, a
~500-byte self-hosting hex assembler.

DOWNLOAD

  git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/mes.git

Here is the GNU mes home page:
    https://gnu.org/s/mes/

For a summary of changes and contributors, see:
  https://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=mes.git;a=shortlog;h=v0.26.2
or run this command from a git-cloned mes directory:
  git shortlog v0.26..v0.26.2

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature:
  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mes/mes-0.26.2.tar.gz
  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mes/mes-0.26.2.tar.gz.sig

Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/mes/mes-0.26.2.tar.gz
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/mes/mes-0.26.2.tar.gz.sig

Here are the SHA1 and SHA256 checksums:

  dbc1bdbcc4784555cf8afdcf6d4ab7717f3b5892  mes-0.26.2.tar.gz
  2fb8bf99f13c4b769af2f50d2dceac0c25caccc6342b65e31121456f253d0a88  mes-0.26.2.tar.gz

Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify mes-0.26.2.tar.gz.sig

The signature should match the fingerprint of the following key:

  pub   rsa4096 2018-04-08 [SC]
        1A85 8392 E331 EAFD B8C2  7FFB F3C1 A0D9 C1D6 5273
  uid   Jan (janneke) Nieuwenhuizen <janneke@gnu.org>

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
or that public key has expired, try the following commands to retrieve
or refresh it, and then rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

  gpg --recv-keys 1A858392E331EAFDB8C27FFBF3C1A0D9C1D65273

As a last resort to find the key, you can try the official GNU
keyring:

  wget -q https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
  gpg --keyring gnu-keyring.gpg --verify mes-0.26.2.tar.gz.sig

Alternatively, Mes can be installed using GNU Guix:

  guix pull
  guix install mes
