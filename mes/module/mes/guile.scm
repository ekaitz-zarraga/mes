;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; MesCC uses the '(mes guile)' module to provide compatibility shims
;;; so that Guile looks more like Mes.  We stub it out here because Mes
;;; already is Mes.  We could re-export symbols, but MesCC doesn't care
;;; one way or the other.
;;;
;;; Code:

(define-module (mes guile))
